# Designs

This folder is intended for all visual and UI/UX design assets related to Recipe Empire.

## Purpose

- Store design references for the user interface
- Share Figma links, mockups, and exported assets
- Serve as a visual guide for developers and stakeholders

## Possible contents

- Screenshots or exports from Figma
- Wireframes (low and high fidelity)
- Branding elements (colors, typography, logo)
- Design iterations or feedback notes

## Guidelines

- When uploading images, prefer `.png` or `.jpg` formats and optimize for size
- Name files clearly, e.g., `home-wireframe-v1.png`
- Link external design tools (like Figma) in a markdown file if necessary
