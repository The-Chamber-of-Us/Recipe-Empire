# Backend

This folder is reserved for backend-related code and logic.

Although Recipe Empire will likely use a BaaS (Backend as a Service) like **Firebase** or **Supabase**, this directory can be used to:

- Organize **serverless functions** (e.g. Firebase Cloud Functions or Supabase Edge Functions)
- Store **backend-related configuration** if needed
- Document any custom backend logic that complements the BaaS setup

If we end up needing server-side functionality, such as processing form submissions or automating data workflows, this is where it can live.

_Leave this folder empty for now unless needed during development._
